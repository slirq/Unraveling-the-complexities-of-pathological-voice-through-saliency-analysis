## Abstract

The human voice is a crucial communication tool, and disruptions due to disorders and habits necessitate effective diagnosis. This study proposes three different neural network architectures for multi-class classification of voice pathologies, including Hyperkinetic Dysphonia, Hypokinetic Dysphonia, Reflux Laryngitis, and healthy voices. The models utilize UNet++ autoencoder-based denoiser techniques for accurate feature extraction. Saliency analysis identifies crucial features, revealing the importance of detecting regions of inaudible high-pitch sounds for voice abnormality classification. The study achieves high accuracy, with the MLP model reaching 97.1%, the STFT model exhibiting increased sensitivity of 99.8%, and the MFCC model maintaining 97.1% accuracy with a smaller size. The findings have potential applications in clinical settings and specialized audio-capturing tools.
